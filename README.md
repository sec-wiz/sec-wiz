## ðŸŒ± Where I am Presently
I'm currently developing my scripting skills in __Phython__ and __Shell__. Using Tryhackme to gain hands on and near real-world experience via labs that will further enhance my growth; really excited about this journey as I'm commited to being the better version of myself.
